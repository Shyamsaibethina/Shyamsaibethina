### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Here are some things I've made:
* [mathgenerator](https://github.com/lukew3/mathgenerator) - A math problem generator with a large variety of problem types, usable as a python package.
* [CourtReport](https://github.com/Shyamsaibethina/courtreport) - An iOS and MacOS that displays nearby courts with important information, made with Swift and SwiftUI
